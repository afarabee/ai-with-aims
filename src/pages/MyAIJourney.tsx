            If you had told me a few years ago that I'd be spending late nights tweaking prompts, training small models, and building digital assistants, I probably would've smiled politely and changed the subject. Yet here we are. And I have never felt more curious, creative, or fulfilled by the work in front of me.
          </p>

            From Product Management to Possibility
          </h2>
          <p className="font-narrow text-lg text-dark-graphite leading-relaxed mb-4">
            For more than fifteen years, I built a career inside large organizations like Cigna, Express Scripts, and American Express. My focus was always the same: create products that matter, solve real problems, and design for humans, not systems. I have always believed that product management sits at the intersection of technology, business, and empathy.
          </p>
          <p className="font-narrow text-lg text-dark-graphite leading-relaxed mb-6">
            When generative AI began moving from headlines to hands-on experimentation, something clicked for me. This was more than a new tool. It was a new way of thinking about intelligence and interaction. The product manager in me saw a bridge forming between machine logic and human understanding, and I wanted to be part of building it.
          </p>

            The Spark: Generative AI Meets the Enterprise
          </h2>
          <p className="font-narrow text-lg text-dark-graphite leading-relaxed mb-4">
            My first experiments were small: rewriting user stories, building internal automations, exploring prompts that could mimic team workflows. One prototype led to another, and soon I was helping roll out generative AI pilots at Charles River Laboratories.
          </p>
          <p className="font-narrow text-lg text-dark-graphite leading-relaxed mb-6">
            That experience changed how I think about technology adoption inside regulated industries. AI is not a single feature. It is an organizational capability. Over the past year, I have also earned a Generative AI Specialization, diving deep into governance, enablement, and evaluation frameworks that make AI both useful and responsible.

            AI with Aims is more than a portfolio. It is a living record of what I am learning, building, and sharing. My goal is to show what it looks like when real product teams apply AI thoughtfully inside complex environments.
